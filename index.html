    <p>The sun is very big and massive, in fact the sun makes up 99.98% of the entire solar systems mass and the other 0.02% is everything else. The earth needs the sun because The sun's gravity holds everything in place and the earth needs more heat from the sun. The sun is almost 1 million miles across! while the earth is only 8,500 miles across, the sun can also hold 1.2 million earths inside it. Earth used to be a scorching planet with lava lakes everywhere 4.5 billion years ago a giant mars sized object collided with earth and made the moon, the earth survived the explosion luckly. The sun is 93-98 million miles across and yet it only takes light 8 minutes and 30 seconds to reach earth from the sun, after all, light goes at a speed of a staggering 186,000 mps, which is faster than a particle in  particle accelerator which goes as fast as 160,000 mps, so if the sun stops giving light, there will be still 8 1/2 min until the light is gone.</p>
